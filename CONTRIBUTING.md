# Guidelines for Pull Requests

Ideally the following would be included:

* Tests.
* A changelog entry in `docs/sources/news.rst`, if it's something non-trivial.
* Documentation if it's a new feature.

However, if you have some code in progress and you don't have the time for all the above, submit the PR anyway and we'll figure something out.
